## Overview
For this analysis, we are using Citi Bike data from NYC to gain an understanding of the most common times users take out bikes, the gender breakdown of bikes, the most common days people use bikes, and many more points using a Tableau Story. Our main goal is to use data visualizations to show future investors that we have an understanding of the landscape of the bike rental market. Using the different aspects of data such as gender, trip duration, start and stop times, usertype, etc. - we can make a conclusion on the best way to market and structure a new bike riding company for success. 

## Results
### Deliverable 1

We converted the data in the default Jupyter Notebook file to have the trip duration as a datetime element with correct time format. The updated code can be found [here](https://github.com/mooshak21/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb).

Here we have added a couple more visualizations to help with our analysis:

## Summary
The main takeaway we can see from our charts is that there are the main times that people take out bikes are during the workdays when people are most likely commuting with Thursday around 5PM having the highest concentration. Additionally, with the gender breakdown we can see that Males are the highest population of users and more specifically Male subscribers. This can be due to many factors which will require more research. One reason may be that Males more commonly where pants for work attire while Females may where things that don't fully cover their legs making riding a bike more uncomfortable. It could also be that Males simply use the bikes more in general. 

Some visualizations that would definitely be useful to look at are the "Most Common Start Stations" and "Most Common Drop-off Stations". This would be beneficial for our analysis because we could see where we would need to supply more bikes and in turn suply more docking stations. Overall, having more data and insight can never be a bad thing.
